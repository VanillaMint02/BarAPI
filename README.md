# BarAPI
This is a bar API made to ease the control of the menus by bartenders.
It is made out of a front end project, and a back end project.
I developed the front end project using next.js, a framework akin to react.js
Languages used for front end : HTML,css,Javascript.

The back end part of the project was made using ASP.NET framework, with SQLite and Newtonsoft Json.

A Server side was made using Microsoft Management Studio 2018, which contains all the model data necessary
in order for this program to work.
